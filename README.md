# React-Demo

The application contains Home page, Header, Body and Footer component.
The React Demo application used to track cryptocurrency prices (not in real-time). It consist of a table where up to ten cryptocurrency prices can be tracked at the same time but initially, only five will appear. The user can add the remaining five through a drop-down, at which point they would get removed from the drop-down. The user is able to remove cryptocurrencies from the table through a remove button until there is only one remaining, of course doing so will add them back to the drop-down. 

Each row in the table should display the following information: 
CMC rank, 
symbol 
price1 
price2
price3 
price4 
price5 
price6 
price7 
price8 
price9 
price20 

The user should be able to sort the table by rank and price.

Body container contains 2 drop down options for adding and removing price columns from the result crypt data table.
